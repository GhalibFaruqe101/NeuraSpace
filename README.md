# NeuraSpace – AI Based Smart Workspace Console Assistant 

## Project Description: 

NeuraSpace is a desktop-based AI productivity assistant that monitors and improves a user’s work environment using sensor data and AI logic. It uses OOP principles to structure features like light and temperature monitoring, AI recommendations, and real-time feedback, and includes two types of users (Admin and Member). The system logs sensor data to a database, analyzes it, and gives smart suggestions for enhancing focus and comfort. Built as a console application, it serves as a lightweight productivity aid.
